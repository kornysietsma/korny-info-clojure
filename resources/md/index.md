# Welcome

This is Korny's dumping ground for clojure info.  Some is for helping workmates and friends getting
started with clojure - and quite a bit is helping me with my short-term memory issues.

I might enable comments, rss and the like here some time.  If you want something more interactive, take a look at my [blog](http://blog.korny.info) - or feel free to e-mail me at korny (at) sietsma (dot) com.
