# Welcome

This is Korny's dumping ground for clojure info.  Some is for helping workmates and friends getting
started with clojure - and quite a bit is helping me with my short-term memory issues.

I might enable comments, rss and the like here some time.  If you want something more interactive, take a look at my [blog](http://blog.korny.info) - or feel free to e-mail me at korny (at) sietsma (dot) com.

This is getting pretty old - I might kill it soon, or repurpose it to a more
generic site, as I don't do as much clojure as I used to :(
