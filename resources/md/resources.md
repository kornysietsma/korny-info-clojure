# clojure resources

These are things I use all the time:

* [Clojure cheat sheet](http://jafingerhut.github.io/cheatsheet-clj-1.3/cheatsheet-tiptip-cdocs-summary.html)
    * or there's the official one at http://clojure.org/cheatsheet but the above one is generally better
* the [Clojure toolbox](http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/) for "what library does X?"

## language and api docs

* http://clojure.org/documentation - main language documentation site
* http://clojure.github.io/clojure/ - official api docs
* http://clojure-doc.org/ - unofficial doc site, has some useful examples (linked from the cheat sheet above)

## Essential libraries

* [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) for building
* [Midge](https://github.com/marick/Midje#readme) for testing
    * and the [Midje wiki](https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki) for more docs
* [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) for core web functionality
    * the [ring spec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmcgrana/ring/master/SPEC) is also very useful to have by you.
* and [Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure#readme), ring's best buddy.
